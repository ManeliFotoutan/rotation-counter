# rotation-counter

This project contains Python implementations of two self-balancing binary search trees: **AVL Tree** and **Red-Black Tree (RB Tree)**. The code inserts a dataset into both trees and counts the total number of rotations performed during insertions. This allows comparison of the balancing effort between the two tree types.


##  Features

- **AVL Tree**
  - Maintains strict balance using node heights.
  - Performs left and right rotations to rebalance.
  - Counts single and double rotations during insertion.

- **Red-Black Tree**
  - Maintains balance by enforcing color properties.
  - Uses rotations and recoloring during insertions.
  - Counts rotations performed to fix violations.

- Insert arbitrary datasets into either tree and track rotation counts.


##  Files

- `main.py` â€“ Main script implementing both AVL and Red-Black trees.
- [`problem.pdf`](./problem.pdf) â€“ Detailed description of the algorithm, design decisions, and complexity analysis.


##  Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed. Then install any required libraries:

> ðŸ”¹ This project only uses standard Python libraries (`random`, `time`, etc.).  
> ðŸ”¹ No external packages are required for running the code.

 Usage
Clone the repository or copy the code into a Python file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rotation-counter.git
cd rotation-counter
```
Open main.py and modify the dataset if needed.
Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
The output will display the total number of rotations for both trees.

## Code Explanation
AVLNode and AVLTree classes:

Implements an AVL tree with node heights.

Automatically balances after insertion using rotations.

RBNode and RBTree classes:

Implements a Red-Black tree with color and parent pointers.

Enforces red-black properties with rotations and recoloring.

Each tree maintains a rotations counter to track the number of balancing operations.

Example datasets are included to demonstrate functionality.

You can also uncomment the large dataset block to evaluate performance under more data.

## Example Output
mathematica
```bash
Total rotations in AVL Tree: 12
Total rotations in Red-Black Tree: 7
```
## Notes
The large dataset section is commented out to prevent long execution times.

Red-Black Tree implementation uses sentinel TNULL nodes for simplification.

Rotations are tracked separately in both trees and compared at the end.

If you plan to extend functionality (e.g. visualization), you might optionally install:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
